Use this application to have a Pinterest-like experience. The user will have access to full CRUD functionality. Upon signing in to the application via Google Authentication, the user will see several boards with different categories and will have the ability to click on a certain board to view pins associated.

When the user is on the single board view, there is a button that allows the user to go back to all boards. The user has access to delete pins from the boards, as well as, the ability to delete entire boards.

The user has access to create new pins and/or boards, and will be able to change which board a pin belongs to.
